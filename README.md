Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language. With Terraform, you can automate the deployment and management of cloud resources across various providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. It enables you to create reproducible, consistent environments, making infrastructure management more efficient and less error-prone. By using Terraform, you can version your infrastructure configurations, collaborate with team members, and streamline your development and operations workflows.
